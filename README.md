# ML_Projects
I have tried to make projects given as assignment in Andrew Ng's ML course in Python3 myself. I have successfully completed that course. I am just trying to implement them in Python myself.

Hope you find them useful. Your suggestions are always welcome :)

FIRST PROJECT GOAL: Here we will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you 
are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
The file ex1data1.txt (available under week 2's assignment material) contains the dataset for our linear regression exercise. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
